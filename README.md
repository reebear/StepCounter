# StepCounter

I wanted to understand how to get the step counter information from my Apple Watch. In order to do this, I have been using a three
-step process (pun intended):
1. get the data from the watch to a local computer using an app
2. convert the Apple Health XML file to a .csv file
  in order to achieve this, I am using jameno's script
  https://github.com/jameno/Simple-Apple-Health-XML-to-CSV
4. process the .csv file and get the important information out and store it in a .xlsx file
