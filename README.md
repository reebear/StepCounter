# StepCounter

I wanted to understand how to get the step counter information from my Apple Watch. In order to do this, I have been using a three
-step process (pun intended):
1. get the data from the watch to a local computer using an app
2. convert the XML file to a .csv file
3. process the .csv file and get the important information out and store it in a .xlsx file
